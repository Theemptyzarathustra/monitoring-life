## üìù Usage

- **Set Alert/Deadline**: Use the three-dot menu (top right) or the bell button (bottom right) to add a deadline for a category.
- **View Alerts**: Click the bell button to see all deadlines. Overdue tasks will pulse in red.

- **Restore Archive**: Use the three-dot menu to view and restore previous archives.
- **Clean Data**: Use the three-dot menu to clean all data (optionally archive first).

## ‚ö° Customization
- **Categories**: Edit the `categories` array in `src/components/MonitoringMyLife.tsx` to add/remove categories.
- **Colors & Icons**: Change the `icon` and `color` fields in the same array.
- **Localization**: Uses Indonesian locale for dates/times by default.

## üêû Troubleshooting
### MUI v7 Grid Errors
- Material-UI v7 removed the `item` and `container` props from the `Grid` component. Use `Grid2` from `@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2` for grid layouts, or refactor to use `Stack`/`Box`/CSS Flexbox.
- If you see errors like `Property 'item' does not exist on type 'Grid'`, update your code to use the new API.

### Data Persistence
- All data is stored in your browser's localStorage. Clearing browser data will remove your notes, alerts, and archives.
